## What are the aims of this course?

Data are everywhere. Data science already became a key element in many research and industrial areas. The primary aim of this course is to learn basic concepts and skills for data analysis, including concepts of random variables, sampling distributions, hypothesis testing, linear modeling, data visualization, etc., preparing you for your life after graduation in this data-are-everywhere age. However, this is not the only aim of this class. Statistics goes beyond just data analysis, I believe. Statistics is a way of thinking and reasoning. It helps with scientific reasoning and critical thinking. Thus, I hope this class could provide you with some useful tips for scientific thinking and reasoning. 

## Course format (flipped classroom) and expectations

This class is designed in a flipped classroom format, which is a new way of teaching and learning. Different from the traditional learning environment (passively listening to the lecture in the class and doing homework at home), in the flipped classroom, you will listen to the lecture at home and do homework and practice in the classroom. I personally experienced this format of learning during my Ph.D. (for the Machine Learning class) and deeply enjoyed it. I found the flipped classroom helped students stay engaged and provided a good environment for hands-on experience. 

For each week, we will use one class for watching pre-recorded video lectures (from the last few years' work) and the other class for the activities. It is crucial to watch the video lectures to participate in the class activity. Thus I might give you a quiz for each class. 


## Textbooks

Main textbook: <br>
>"Stats: Data and Models" by De Veaux, Velleman, and Bock

Supplements (not required): <br>
>"Statistical Thinking for the 21st Century" by Russ Poldrack [Link](http://statsthinking21.org/)
<br>"Seeing theory" [Link](http://students.brown.edu/seeing-theory/index.html#firstPage)
<br>"The Seven Pillars of Statistical Wisdom" by Stephen M. Stigler [Amazon Link](https://www.amazon.com/Seven-Pillars-Statistical-Wisdom/dp/0674088913/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1505049565&sr=8-1&keywords=seven+pillars+of+statistical+wisdom)
<br>"History of Statistics Reading Group" (CMU) [Link](http://stat.cmu.edu/~lrichard/history-of-stats/history-of-stats.html)


## Softwares

Teaching how to use statistics packages or programming is not the main focus of this class. This class is more about statistical methods and theories. However, software packages and computer programming are actually essential in learning statistics. Therefore, I will provide some lectures about software packages for statistical analysis (e.g., [JAMOVI](https://www.jamovi.org/)). In addition, I might use Matlab, Python, or R sometimes. You can download Matlab through SKKU. Python and R are open-source programming languages.
